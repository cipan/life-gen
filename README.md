# life-gen
Game of Life pattern generator and tools
Running this requires Ruby and the gem RMagick. The project was originally created by Thomas Robinson but here is included a few changes to work for the current version of Ruby. 
See: http://tlrobinson.net/blog/2009/02/game-of-life-generator/
To run type "ruby life.rb -s mytext mytext.rle" into a terminal at the repo's directory for a text scroller, 
or pass it “ruby life.rb -i imagepath” for an image pattern
